ðŸ“Œ Real-World Problem Statement:

In logistics and delivery systems, identifying the most efficient delivery route between two warehouse locations is crucial for minimizing fuel costs, reducing delivery times, and improving operational efficiency.

This project simulates a shortest-path routing system for a delivery company using real or synthetic road network data.

The system takes input from a CSV-based dataset (or simulated API) representing city roads and intersections. It then builds a graph, runs an optimized shortest path algorithm (like BFS or Dijkstra), and outputs the most efficient route with distance metrics.

The goal is to showcase the data engineering pipeline â€” from data ingestion and cleaning to transformation, algorithmic processing, and final output visualization.
