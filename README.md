# 📍 Shortest Path Delivery Network (Warehouse Route Optimizer)

This is a real-world simulation of a delivery network that finds the **shortest route between warehouses** using a graph-based approach.  
Built using Python, NetworkX, and Matplotlib, the project mimics how logistics companies optimize delivery routes.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project transforms a classic DSA problem into a **production-style data engineering pipeline**.  
It takes warehouse/road data from a CSV, builds a weighted graph, allows user input for source & destination, calculates the shortest path using **Breadth-First Search**, and visualizes the result with edge distances.

## 🧠 Why This Project?

This isn’t just a pathfinding algorithm — it’s a **data engineering pipeline**:
- Raw data ingestion (CSV)
- Data modeling (graph construction)
- Algorithmic processing (BFS)
- Result visualization (Matplotlib)
- Clean, modular code (real-world-ready)

  
## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Python** – Core scripting
- **NetworkX** – Graph construction & traversal
- **Matplotlib** – Graph visualization
- **CSV** – Simulated warehouse/road data
- *(Future: API integration, Streamlit UI, Airflow orchestration)*
